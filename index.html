    <h1>Important Announcement</h1>
    <p>
        Due to Synapse X's collaboration with Roblox on their anti-cheat system, I am compelled to cease all my current projects. The future actions of Mastadawn and Moerii remain uncertain, but for my part, I have chosen to disconnect from everyone temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
        My focus will now shift towards my real-life commitments and enjoying games with friends, including Marker. This decision was not made lightly, and I appreciate your understanding.
